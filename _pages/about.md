Hi there! My name is Ayomide (friends call me ayo/ay â€” take your pick, I'm not fussy) and I'm a data scientist with a passion for solving complex problems and a background in physics.

After completing my undergraduate degree in physics, I was drawn to the world of data science and its potential to extract insights from large, complex datasets. I went on to pursue a graduate degree in applied physics from the University of South Florida, where I honed my skills in programming, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

As a machine learning researcher in physics, I worked on several exciting projects that involved using machine learning to analyze large datasets and extract valuable insights. One of my most notable projects involved developing a machine learning model to predict the properties of new materials, which could potentially revolutionize the field of materials science. I also worked on a project that used machine learning to analyze data from biological particles, which helped us better understand the movement of these subatomic particles.

Since then, I've worked on a variety of data science projects in various industries, from developing predictive models for financial forecasting to analyzing customer behavior for e-commerce companies. I love the challenge of working with messy, unstructured data and using it to uncover hidden patterns and trends.

My background in physics has given me a unique perspective on data science, as I'm used to thinking about complex systems and analyzing them using mathematical models. This has helped me develop a strong foundation in data visualization, statistical inference, and hypothesis testing.

Outside of work, I enjoy swimming, photography, and exploring new restaurants in my city. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a data scientist, and I'm excited to see where my skills and expertise will take me next. This is a live update of a data scientist getting better at her job, one fumble at a time.
